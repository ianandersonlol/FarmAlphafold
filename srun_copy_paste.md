# Documentation

This script generates a file with a given name and writes a series of commands to it. The purpose of the file is to generate outputs based on inputs that are passed to the script as command line arguments. 

## Requirements

This script requires the following external libraries:

- `sys`
- `os`
- `time`
- `colorama`
- `datetime`

## Usage

The script expects two command line arguments to be passed when it is run. The first argument is the output directory and the second argument is the input directory. 

If no arguments are passed, the script will print an error message and exit. If only one argument is passed, the script will print an error message and exit. If more than two arguments are passed, the script will print an error message and exit.

The script will validate the paths passed as arguments to ensure they are valid paths. If the paths are not valid, error messages will be printed and the script will exit.

The script generates a file with a name based on the current time and writes a series of commands to it. These commands are used to generate outputs based on the inputs provided. 

This script is specifically designed to generate outputs for files with `.fasta` or `.fa` extensions in the input directory. If there are no files with these extensions in the input directory, the script will not generate any outputs. 

## Example

```
python script.py /path/to/output/directory /path/to/input/directory
```

This will generate a file with a name based on the current time and write a series of commands to it. These commands will generate outputs based on the inputs in the input directory and save them to the output directory.
